        <strong>croissant</strong>, French pastry that is typically
        crescent-shaped, which is the origin of its French name. <br />Although
        there are earlier culinary references to “croissants,” the first recipe
        for the croissant as it is known today emerged only as recently as 1906.
        <br />The huge growth in popularity of the croissant appears to have
        been a 20th-century sensation. <br />
        The classic crescent-shaped French pastry is made from a yeast-based
        dough, which is rolled and layered to incorporate butter.
